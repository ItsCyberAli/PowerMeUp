This is a powershell reverse shell that executes the commands and or scripts that you add to the powerreverse.ps1 file as well as a small library of Post-Exploitation scripts. This also can be used for post exploitation and lateral movement even.
Please use at your own risk I am not and will not be responsible for your actions. Also this reverse shell currently is not detected by Windows Defender. If you want to use this make sure to detup a Digital Ocean VPS and have the script connect back there or your C2.
